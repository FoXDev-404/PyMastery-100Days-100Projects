## Day 21: Snake Game 🐍

- **Description**: A classic Snake game built using Python's Turtle module.
- **What I Learned**:
  - **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** – Designing modular and reusable code
  - **Keyboard Event Handling** – Using `onkey()` for responsive controls
  - **Game State Management** – Implementing pause, resume, and level progression
  - **File Handling** – Saving and loading high scores

### Features

- Smooth snake movement with direction controls
- High score tracking with auto-save functionality
- Pause and resume functionality
- Level system with increasing difficulty
- Special food items with higher points

### How to Play

1. Run the script using `python main.py` in the `Day21` directory.
2. Use the arrow keys to control the snake's movement.
3. Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own tail.
4. Collect food to grow the snake and increase your score.
5. Try to beat your high score!

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Turtle module (pre-installed with Python)

## Day 22: Pong Game 🏓

- **Description**: A recreation of the classic Pong arcade game using Python's Turtle module.
- **What I Learned**:
  - **Advanced OOP Concepts** – Implementing multiple classes with inheritance
  - **Game Physics** – Creating realistic ball movement and paddle collisions
  - **Two-player Controls** – Managing simultaneous input for different players
  - **Speed Mechanics** – Progressive difficulty with increasing ball speed

### Features

- Two-player gameplay with separate controls
- Dynamic ball physics with increasing speed after each hit
- Score tracking system with winning condition
- Boundary detection for paddles and ball
- Visual elements like center court line

### How to Play

1. Run the script using `python main.py` in the `Day22` directory.
2. Player 1 (left): Use 'W' and 'S' keys to move paddle up and down.
3. Player 2 (right): Use 'Up' and 'Down' arrow keys to control paddle.
4. The ball speeds up each time it hits a paddle.
5. First player to reach 5 points wins the game!

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Turtle module (pre-installed with Python)
