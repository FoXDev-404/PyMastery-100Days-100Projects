## Day 21: Snake Game 🐍

- **Description**: A classic Snake game built using Python's Turtle module.
- **What I Learned**:
  - **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** – Designing modular and reusable code
  - **Keyboard Event Handling** – Using `onkey()` for responsive controls
  - **Game State Management** – Implementing pause, resume, and level progression
  - **File Handling** – Saving and loading high scores

### Features

- Smooth snake movement with direction controls
- High score tracking with auto-save functionality
- Pause and resume functionality
- Level system with increasing difficulty
- Special food items with higher points

### How to Play

1. Run the script using `python main.py` in the `Day21` directory.
2. Use the arrow keys to control the snake's movement.
3. Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own tail.
4. Collect food to grow the snake and increase your score.
5. Try to beat your high score!

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Turtle module (pre-installed with Python)
