## Day 21: Snake Game üêç

- **Description**: A classic Snake game built using Python's Turtle module.
- **What I Learned**:
  - **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** ‚Äì Designing modular and reusable code
  - **Keyboard Event Handling** ‚Äì Using `onkey()` for responsive controls
  - **Game State Management** ‚Äì Implementing pause, resume, and level progression
  - **File Handling** ‚Äì Saving and loading high scores

### Features

- Smooth snake movement with direction controls

- Pause and resume functionality
- Level system with increasing difficulty
- Special food items with higher points

### How to Play

1. Run the script using `python main.py` in the `Day21` directory.
2. Use the arrow keys to control the snake's movement.
3. Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own tail.
4. Collect food to grow the snake and increase your score.
5. Try to beat your high score!

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Turtle module (pre-installed with Python)

## Day 22: Pong Game üèì

- **Description**: A recreation of the classic Pong arcade game using Python's Turtle module.
- **What I Learned**:
  - **Advanced OOP Concepts** ‚Äì Implementing multiple classes with inheritance
  - **Game Physics** ‚Äì Creating realistic ball movement and paddle collisions
  - **Two-player Controls** ‚Äì Managing simultaneous input for different players
  - **Speed Mechanics** ‚Äì Progressive difficulty with increasing ball speed

### Features

- Two-player gameplay with separate controls
- Dynamic ball physics with increasing speed after each hit
- Score tracking system with winning condition
- Boundary detection for paddles and ball
- Visual elements like center court line

### How to Play

1. Run the script using `python main.py` in the `Day22` directory.
2. Player 1 (left): Use 'W' and 'S' keys to move paddle up and down.
3. Player 2 (right): Use 'Up' and 'Down' arrow keys to control paddle.
4. The ball speeds up each time it hits a paddle.
5. First player to reach 5 points wins the game!

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Turtle module (pre-installed with Python)

<a name="day-23-turtle-crossing-game"></a>

## Day 23: Turtle Crossing Game üê¢

- **Description**: A road crossing game where the player controls a turtle to safely cross a busy road.
- **What I Learned**:
  - **State Management** ‚Äì Implementing different game states (menu, playing, paused, game over)
  - **Collision Detection** ‚Äì Detecting collisions between turtle and cars
  - **Dynamic Difficulty** ‚Äì Increasing game difficulty as levels progress
  - **Lives System** ‚Äì Managing player lives and reset mechanics
  - **Persistent Data** ‚Äì Saving and loading high scores between game sessions

### Features

- Intuitive controls for turtle movement (up, left, right)
- Progressive difficulty with faster traffic at higher levels
- Multiple lives system with visual feedback
- High score tracking across game sessions
- Pause functionality during gameplay
- Visual road markings and varied car sizes

### How to Play

1. Run the script using `python main.py` in the `Day23` directory.
2. Press SPACE to start the game from the menu.
3. Use the UP arrow key to move forward.
4. Use LEFT and RIGHT arrow keys to dodge traffic.
5. Press P to pause/resume the game.
6. Reach the other side to advance to the next level.
7. Avoid collisions with cars - you have 3 lives!

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Turtle module (pre-installed with Python)

<a name="day-24-mail-merge-project"></a>

## Day 24: Mail Merge Project üìß

- **Description**: An automated mail merge system that generates personalized invitation letters from a template.
- **What I Learned**:
  - **File I/O Operations** ‚Äì Reading from and writing to files with context managers
  - **String Manipulation** ‚Äì Replacing placeholder text with actual content
  - **Path Handling** ‚Äì Working with relative and absolute file paths
  - **Batch Processing** ‚Äì Automating the creation of multiple documents

### Features

- Reads names from a list of invited guests
- Uses a template letter with placeholder for personalization
- Generates individual invitation letters for each person
- Demonstrates both relative and absolute path handling
- Implements efficient file handling with context managers
- Maintains original formatting while replacing placeholders

### How It Works

1. The program reads a list of names from `./Input/Names/invited_names.txt`
2. It loads a letter template from `./Input/Letters/starting_letter.txt`
3. For each name, it replaces the `[name]` placeholder in the template
4. Individual personalized letters are saved to the output directory
5. Files are properly closed using context managers for best practice

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- No additional packages required

<a name="day-25-pandas-data-analysis"></a>

## Day 25: Pandas Data Analysis üìä

- **Description**: Data analysis project using the Pandas library to analyze squirrel census data from Central Park.
- **What I Learned**:
  - **Pandas Library** ‚Äì Working with DataFrame objects for data manipulation
  - **CSV Handling** ‚Äì Reading from and writing to CSV files with Pandas
  - **Data Filtering** ‚Äì Using conditions to filter data from DataFrames
  - **Data Aggregation** ‚Äì Counting and summarizing data based on categories
  - **Data Export** ‚Äì Converting processed data back to CSV format

### Features

- Reads and processes large CSV datasets
- Filters data based on specific conditions
- Performs count operations on categorical data
- Creates new DataFrames from analysis results
- Exports processed data to CSV files
- Demonstrates pandas syntax for data selection and manipulation

### How It Works

1. The program reads squirrel census data from a CSV file
2. It counts squirrels by their primary fur color (Gray, Cinnamon, Black)
3. The counts are stored in a new DataFrame with appropriate column names
4. The summarized data is exported to a new CSV file for easy viewing
5. Shows multiple ways to access, filter, and analyze data with pandas

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Pandas library (`pip install pandas`)

## Day 26: NATO Alphabet Project üî§

- **Description**: A program that converts words into their NATO phonetic alphabet equivalents using Python and pandas.
- **What I Learned**:
  - **Dictionary Comprehensions** ‚Äì Creating dictionaries efficiently from DataFrames
  - **User Input Validation** ‚Äì Handling invalid input gracefully
  - **Data Mapping** ‚Äì Mapping user input to corresponding phonetic code words
  - **Error Handling** ‚Äì Using try/except for robust user experience

### Features

- Converts any word into a list of NATO phonetic code words
- Handles both uppercase and lowercase input
- Provides clear error messages for invalid characters
- Reads the NATO alphabet from a CSV file using pandas

### How It Works

1. The program loads a CSV file containing the NATO alphabet.
2. It creates a dictionary mapping each letter to its code word.
3. The user enters a word; the program outputs the phonetic code words.
4. If the input contains non-alphabetic characters, the user is prompted again.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Pandas library (`pip install pandas`)
- `nato_phonetic_alphabet.csv` file in the project directory
