## Day 41: HTML Anime Ranking Project ðŸŒ¸

- **Description**: A simple HTML project that displays a personal ranking of favorite anime series. This project demonstrates the use of HTML headings, lists, and basic structure to present information in a clear and visually appealing way.
- **What I Learned**:

  - **Address Formatting** â€“ Presenting addresses with line breaks and proper tags
  - **Horizontal Rules** â€“ Separating content visually with `<hr>`
  - **Self-Closing Tags** â€“ Using `<br />` and others for formatting
  - **Basic Page Layout** â€“ Organizing information for readability

### How to Use

2. Review the HTML structure in a code editor to learn about headings, paragraphs, and formatting tags.
