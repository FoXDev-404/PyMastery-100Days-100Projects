### Day 11: **Blackjack Game** ðŸŽ®

- **Description**: A text-based implementation of the classic Blackjack card game (also known as 21).
- **What I Learned**:
  - **Functions with Outputs** â€“ Creating functions that return values
  - **Game Logic** â€“ Implementing complex game rules
  - **Random Module** â€“ Generating random cards
  - **Conditional Logic** â€“ Determining win/loss conditions
- **Link to Code**: [Project Code](./Day11/projectDay11.py)

### Features

- Automatic adjustment of Ace values (11 â†’ 1) when needed
- Dealer follows casino rules (must draw until 17)
- Clean interface with screen clearing between games
- Special handling for Blackjack (natural 21)
- Colorful emojis to indicate game results

### How to Play

- Run the script using `python projectDay11.py`
- Follow the prompts to hit (get another card) or stand
- Aim for a score of 21 without going over
- The dealer will draw cards until reaching at least 17
- Win by having a higher score than the dealer without busting

### Rules Summary

- Cards 2-10 are worth their face value
- Jack, Queen, and King are worth 10 points each
- Ace is worth 11 points unless that would cause a bust, then it's worth 1 point
- Blackjack (Ace + 10-value card) automatically wins unless dealer also has blackjack
