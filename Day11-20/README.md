- Dealer follows casino rules (must draw until 17)
- Clean interface with screen clearing between games
- Special handling for Blackjack (natural 21)
- Colorful emojis to indicate game results

### How to Play

- Run the script using `python projectDay11.py`

- Aim for a score of 21 without going over
- The dealer will draw cards until reaching at least 17
- Win by having a higher score than the dealer without busting

### Rules Summary

- Cards 2-10 are worth their face value
- Jack, Queen, and King are worth 10 points each
- Ace is worth 11 points unless that would cause a bust, then it's worth 1 point
- Blackjack (Ace + 10-value card) automatically wins unless dealer also has blackjack

### Day 18: **Hirst Painting Project** üé®

- **Description**: A Python program that recreates Damien Hirst's famous spot paintings using the Turtle graphics module.
- **What I Learned**:
  - **Turtle Graphics** ‚Äì Using Python's built-in drawing module for visual outputs
  - **RGB Color System** ‚Äì Working with RGB tuples to generate colorful patterns
  - **Algorithmic Drawing** ‚Äì Creating structured patterns with nested loops
  - **Color Extraction** ‚Äì Using the colorgram package to extract colors from images
- **Link to Code**: [Project Code](./Day18/Penting_Project/project.py)

### Features

- Creates a 10√ó10 grid of colored dots resembling Hirst's spot paintings
- Uses a palette of extracted colors from real artwork
- Implements optimized drawing with hidden turtle and maximum speed
- Precise dot positioning with mathematical calculations
- Randomly selects colors for each dot to create visual interest
- Clean, well-structured code with clear comments

### How It Works

- The program positions the turtle at the starting point (bottom left corner)
- It methodically draws dots in a grid pattern, moving right across each row
- After completing a row, the turtle moves up to begin the next row
- Each dot is assigned a random color from the extracted palette
- The drawing continues until the entire 10√ó10 grid is filled
- The result is a colorful dot pattern similar to Hirst's famous artwork

### Technical Implementation

- Sets up turtle with penup() to avoid drawing lines between dots
- Uses dot() method for consistent circle shapes
- Leverages turtle.colormode(255) to enable RGB color tuples
- Implements efficient path planning to minimize unnecessary movement
- Creates reusable color extraction functionality for future projects
