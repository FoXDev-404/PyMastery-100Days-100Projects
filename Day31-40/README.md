## Day 31: Flash Card App 🗣️

- **Description**: A language learning application that uses digital flash cards to help users memorize French vocabulary.
- **What I Learned**:
  - **Tkinter UI Development** – Creating a polished user interface with Canvas and images
  - **Timer Management** – Using window.after() to schedule operations and handle timeouts
  - **State Tracking** – Managing card flipping and word learning states
  - **Data Persistence** – Saving progress to files to continue learning across sessions
  - **Error Handling** – Gracefully handling file operations and potential errors

### Features

- Digital flash cards showing French words and their English translations
- Automatic card flipping after 3 seconds to reveal translations
- Progress tracking to focus on unlearned words
- Visual feedback with different card designs for front/back
- Intuitive buttons for marking words as known/unknown
- Persistent storage of learning progress

### How to Use

1. Run the script using `python main.py` in the `Day31` directory.
2. A French word will appear on the screen.
3. Try to recall the English translation before the card flips automatically.
4. After the card flips (or you've made your guess), either:
   - Click the ✓ button if you knew the word (removes it from your learning pile)
   - Click the ✗ button if you didn't know it (keeps it for future review)
5. Your progress is automatically saved between sessions.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Tkinter (included with Python)
- Pandas library (`pip install pandas`)
- Flash card images in the "images" directory
- French words data file in the "data" directory

## Day 32: Birthday Wisher 📧

- **Description**: An automated email system that sends birthday wishes to contacts on their special day.
- **What I Learned**:
  - **Email Automation** – Using SMTP protocol to programmatically send emails
  - **Environment Variables** – Securing sensitive information like passwords
  - **Date & Time Handling** – Working with datetime to check for birthdays
  - **String Templates** – Creating personalized email content with dynamic data
  - **CSV Data Processing** – Reading and filtering data from structured files

### Features

- Automatic birthday checks against the current date
- Personalized email messages using letter templates
- Secure credential handling via environment variables
- CSV-based contact management system
- Support for multiple email templates for variety

### How to Use

1. Run the script using `python main.py` in the `Day32` directory.
2. The app will automatically check if anyone in your contacts has a birthday today.
3. If there's a match, it will send a personalized birthday email from your account.
4. Add new contacts to the birthdays.csv file to include them in future checks.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- smtp library (included with Python)
- python-dotenv for environment variable management (`pip install python-dotenv`)
- Gmail account (or other email provider) with app password configured
- CSV file with birthday information
