# PyMastery-100Days-100Projects

Welcome to **PyMastery-100Days-100Projects**! I'm on a mission to master Python by taking on an exciting 100-day coding challenge. Over the next 100 days, I'll be building 100 unique projects, diving into areas like data science, web development, automation, game development, and app creation. Each day is a fresh chance to sharpen my coding skills, tackle real-world problems, and become a Python pro. Come along and join me on this amazing journey of learning and growth!

### Day 2: Tip Calculator

- **Description**: Built a Python script that calculates the tip amount based on the bill total and desired tip percentage.
- **What I Learned**:
  - **Python Primitive Data Types**: Understanding different data types in Python.
  - **Type Error, Type Checking and Type Conversion**: Handling type errors, checking types, and converting between types.
  - **Mathematical Operations in Python**: Performing basic mathematical operations.
  - **Number Manipulation and F-Strings**: Manipulating numbers and using f-strings for formatted output.

### Day 3: Haunted Mansion Escape

- **Description**: Developed a text-based adventure game where the player navigates through a haunted mansion, making choices that influence the outcome. This project focuses on applying control flow, user input, and string manipulation skills learned during the course.

- **What I Learned**:

  - **Control Flow with `if / else` and Conditional Operators**: Implemented decision-making in the game using conditional statements.
  - **Introducing the Modulo Operator**: Applied modulo operations in the game’s logic.
  - **Nested `if` Statements and `elif` Statements**: Used nested conditionals to handle complex game scenarios.
  - **Multiple `If` Statements in Succession**: Managed sequential conditions to create branching paths in the game.
  - **Logical Operators**: Utilized logical operators to combine multiple conditions for more dynamic game responses.
  - **String Literals for ASCII Art**: Employed multi-line string literals to include ASCII art in the game’s narrative.

### Day 4: Rock Paper Scissors
- **Description**: Built a Rock Paper Scissors game using Python, incorporating user inputs and random choices.
- **What I Learned**:
  - **Random Module**: Using random functions to generate choices.
  - **Lists**: Appending items and handling nested lists.
